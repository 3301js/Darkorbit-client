## Story

My initial intention with this project was to create a client for darkorbit that could be used by any user with any operating system (Windows, mac or linux), and had better performance.

When I already had a stable version, I tried to contact darkorbit to give them the client and if they wanted, implement it, modify it, or whatever they wanted ..... but after many attempts:
- Twitter: I never received a reply
- Official darkorbit forum: They delete my posts, saying that I can't publish external links. After talking on discord with an admin, he told me the steps I should follow to publish a post correctly, without a link, as a suggestion, etc.
- Discord: They treated me as if I was trying to steal data or as if I was a hack
- etc...

I abandon the idea of â€‹â€‹contacting Darkorbit.

From now on I will continue to develop utilities for the client, not only as a client to play, but also to develop. With the intention of learning more about electron, js and in general to practice programming, while having fun with it.
